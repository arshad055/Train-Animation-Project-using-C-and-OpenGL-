## Project Overview
This project is a **2D animated computer graphics scene** developed in **C++ using OpenGL and GLUT** in **Code::Blocks IDE**.  
It depicts a **train moving through a station**, surrounded by mountains, trees, clouds, houses, and a road. The project demonstrates **2D animation, object transformations, mouse and keyboard interactivity** in OpenGL.  

The train moves automatically when the program starts, while clouds drift in the sky and other elements create a lively environment. Users can also switch between **day and night modes** using the keyboard.

## Features

- **2D Animated Train** — smoothly moves across the scene  
- **Animated Clouds** — adds motion to the background
- Clock Tower Animation — shows a working clock with rotating hands
- **Scenic Environment** — includes station platform, trees, mountains, houses, road, and grass  
- **Mouse Interaction** — control train movement  
- **Keyboard Controls** — switch between day and night modes

## User Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Left Click (Mouse) | Stop the train |
| Right Click (Mouse) | Start/resume the train |
| `D` (Keyboard) | Switch to Day mode |
| `N` (Keyboard) | Switch to Night mode |

> *No sound effects are implemented in this version.*

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Graphics Library:** OpenGL / GLUT  
- **IDE:** Code::Blocks

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run via Code::Blocks Project
1. Ensure **Code::Blocks** is installed with a C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW).  
2. Make sure **OpenGL and GLUT** libraries are set up.  
3. **Open the `main.cbp` project file** directly in Code::Blocks.  
4. Build and run the project:  
   - Press **F9** or click **Build and Run**.  
5. The train will start moving automatically.  
6. Use **left/right mouse clicks** to stop/resume the train.  
7. Press **`D`** for Day mode and **`N`** for Night mode.  

### Option 2: Run `main.cpp` Directly
1. Open Code::Blocks and create a **new empty console project**.  
2. Add `main.cpp` to the project.  
3. Make sure **OpenGL and GLUT** libraries are linked in the project settings.  
4. Build and run the project.  
5. The train scene and controls will work the same as described above.
